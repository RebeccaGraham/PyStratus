This work was originally derived from the Cloudera CDH Cloud Scripts for managing Hadoop in 
Amazon EC2 (https://wiki.cloudera.com/display/DOC/CDH+Cloud+Scripts). We needed a way to 
manage Hadoop, Cassandra, and other distributed services, thus PyStratus was born. Thanks 
to Cloudera for providing a great starting point for us!Currently only Amazon EC2 is supported, 
but we hope to add new cloud providers very soon.

To get up and running quickly you need the following:

* Python 2.5+
* boto 
* simplejson
* prettytable
* setuptools
* dateutil
* PyYAML
* cElementTree or elementree

You can install the modules from above with easy_install (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)

Check out the project and run "python setup.py install" and the command "stratus" will now available 
and an egg file will be located in your site-packages directory. You may want to run the command with 
sudo to install it for all users.
