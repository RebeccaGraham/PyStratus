To get up and running quickly you need the following:

* Python 2.6+
* boto 
* simplejson
* prettytable
* setuptools
* dateutil

You can install the modules from above with easy_install (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)

Check out the project and run "python setup.py install" and the command "stratus" will now available 
and an egg file will be located in your site-packages directory. You may want to run the command with 
sudo to install it for all users.
