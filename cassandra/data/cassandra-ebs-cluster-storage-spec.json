/**
 * Sample configuration for Cassandra volumes. This file defines two volumes per node
 * defined by the devices /dev/sdj and /dev/sdk. This is VERY important as the configuration
 * of the nodes depend on both devices to be present if EBS is being used to separate the logs
 * and data directory onto different logical volumes for best performance. The snapshot_id and
 * size_gb should be modified to use your own snapshot and the size of that snapshot. Use the 
 * create-formatted-snapshot command to obtain this ID. You may also use an existing snapshot 
 * ID, however, you must make sure it's formatted correctly.
 *
 * The "cn" key below is also very important as the internal mapping of a cassandra node to the
 * role of the instance is defined as CASSANDRA_NODE="cn"
